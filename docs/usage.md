# Usage

[简体中文](usage.zh-CN.md) | [Docs Index](README.md)

## Requirements

- Go 1.25 or newer, matching the module `go` directive.
- A Gnalloy application, recipe, example, or benchmark harness that owns lifecycle and deployment configuration.
- Standalone module verification should set `GOWORK=off` so the module is tested through its published dependency graph.

## Install
```bash
go get gnalloy.org/recipes@dev
```

## Import
```go
import "gnalloy.org/recipes"
```

## Integration Pattern
- Configuration is passed through explicit constructors and option structs rather than package-level mutable state.
- Keep hot-path defaults conservative, bounded, and allocation-aware.
- Raw IP paths normally require administrative privileges or `CAP_NET_RAW` on systems that support raw sockets.

## API Selection

Use the API inventory to choose the exact constructor or option type for your protocol path:

```bash
go doc gnalloy.org/recipes
```

Common current entry points:
- `const HandlerNameHTTP1RequestDecoder = "http1-request-decoder" ...`
- `const HandlerNameMQTTFrameDecoder = "mqtt-frame-decoder" ...`
- `const HandlerNameByteBufEcho = "bytebuf-echo" ...`
- `const HandlerNameWebSocketHandshake = "websocket-handshake" ...`
- `var ErrInvalidRecipe = errors.New("gnalloy/recipes: invalid recipe")`
- `type HTTP1Config struct{ ... }`
- `type HTTP2Config struct{ ... }`
- `type LengthFieldConfig struct{ ... }`
- `type LineConfig struct{ ... }`
- `type MQTTConfig struct{ ... }`
- `type WebSocketServerConfig struct{ ... }`

## Cross-Module Assembly

When multiple Gnalloy repositories are developed together, create a local `go.work` file in your chosen workspace. Keep application-local `replace` directives out of published library modules unless the change is intentionally temporary and never committed.

## Error Handling

Network input, peer behavior, platform capability, and timeout failures must be handled as normal errors. Do not recover protocol correctness by panicking. Return or propagate the module error and close the affected Channel when ownership requires it.
